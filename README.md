# ecoFridge
ecoFridge is a user-friendly web app that allows users to minimize their personal foodwaste by inputting the items they have in their kitchen or soon-to-be expired ingredients. The user can customize their tastes or restrictions (ex: cuisines, allergies, diet) to curate the perfect recipes for their needs. After inputting the ingredients they would like to cook with, the web app fetches recipes from Spoonacular API and generates up to ten recipe cards, with each card containing a mouth-watering picture of the finished result and a link to the recipe for ease of use.

The front-end portion of the app uses graphics created through Invision and a user-friendly interface through Glitch, using HTML and CSS. For the back-end portion, our team utilized Javascript to receive the user inputted data and interact with the recipe API. We fetched the recipe API, Spoonacular which returns a corresponding JSON object, which we then analyzed and altered the HTML to dynamically create cards displaying the recipe pictures and information.
